<h1 align = "center">Street Harassment in Medellin</h1>

Research of an algorithm able to provent the street harassment in Medellin combining distance and harassment risk.

Project for the second-semester course "Data Structures and Algorithms I" (ST0245) taught at EAFIT University (Medellín, Colombia) by prof [Mauricio Toro](https://github.com/mauriciotoro).

## Motivation

Sexual harassment is a problem women experience in their daily life, this can include verbal and non-verbal abuse, and can take place everywhere. Due to this, in order to make women feel more safe, this project and research is about using an algorithm that is able to calculate different paths depending on the distance and the sexual harassment of Medellin streets.

In the Reports of the project, you will find the reasons for the development of this project and the proposed solutions. Also, how all the authors of this, made possible the final results.

## Documentation
**Note:** Please read the [Project Structure](#project-structure) at the start.

This project had a special development and documentation process, according to the course instructions. In the [docs]() folder, you will two folders with documentation. The first one, [reports](), has all the Technical Reports to document the project
